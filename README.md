# Adult Census Income Prediction

## Problem Statement:

<p>The Goal is to predict whether a person has an income of more than 50K a year or not.
This is basically a binary classification problem where a person is classified into the
>50K group or <=50K group.</p>

## Approach
<p>The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning,
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.</p>
<pre> 
<li> Data Exploration     :  I started exploring dataset using pandas,numpy,matplotlib and seaborn. </li>
<li> Data visualization   :  Plotted graphs to get insights about dependent and independent variables. </li>
<li> Feature Engineering  :  Removed missing values and created new features as per insights.</li>
<li> Model Selection I    :  Tested all base models to check the base accuracy.</li>
<li> Model Selection II   :  Performed Hyperparameter tuning using gridsearchCV</li>
<li> Pickle File          :  Selected model as per best accuracy and created pickle file using joblib .</li>
<li> Webpage & deployment :  Created a webpage that takes all the necessary inputs from user and shows output.
                                After that I have deployed project on heroku AWS</li></pre>
